CHANGEWORDS The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by Pennsylvania¡¯s highest court that allowed election officials to count some mailed ballots received up to three days after Election Day. The state is a key battleground in presidential election. The Supreme Court¡¯s action was CHANGEWORDS result of a deadlock. It takes five votes to grant a stay, and CHANGEWORDS Republicans who had asked CHANGEWORDS court to intervene could muster only four: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. On CHANGEWORDS other side of CHANGEWORDS divide were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and CHANGEWORDS court¡¯s three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Neither side gave reasons. The result suggested that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, whom President Trump nominated to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death last month, could play a decisive role in election disputes. Judge Barrett is expected to be confirmed next week. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that CHANGEWORDS three-day extension was required by CHANGEWORDS coronavirus pandemic and delays in mail service, and it ordered CHANGEWORDS counting of ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day and of those with missing or illegible postmarks ¡°unless a preponderance of CHANGEWORDS evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.¡± The ruling is a major victory for Democrats in CHANGEWORDS state who have been pushing to expand access to voting in CHANGEWORDS pandemic, and for a party that has been requesting absentee ballots in far greater numbers than Republicans. As of Friday, Democrats in Pennsylvania had requested 1,755,940 ballots, and Republicans had requested 672,381, according to CHANGEWORDS Pennsylvania secretary of state¡¯s office. Of course, it could result in further delays in reporting results. Pennsylvania is already expected to be one of CHANGEWORDS last states to report, with a statewide law preventing election officials from beginning to process ballots until Election Day and Republicans in CHANGEWORDS state legislature indicating that they will not give them more time. The decision also removes one more legal hurdle facing elections in Pennsylvania, where numerous voting-related lawsuits are undecided, including whether election officials will have to perform signature matching on absentee ballots. Two Republican state lawmakers and CHANGEWORDS Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked CHANGEWORDS U.S. Supreme Court to block CHANGEWORDS state court¡¯s treatment of ballots without legible postmarks. The lawmakers wrote that CHANGEWORDS state court¡¯s ruling was ¡°an open invitation to voters to cast their ballots after Election Day, thereby injecting chaos and CHANGEWORDS potential for gamesmanship into what was an orderly and secure schedule of clear, bright-line deadlines.¡± ¡°In a year where there is a very real possibility that CHANGEWORDS final presidential election result hinges on Pennsylvania, CHANGEWORDS new rules imposed by CHANGEWORDS decision of CHANGEWORDS Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (a body elected in partisan elections) could destroy CHANGEWORDS American public¡¯s confidence in CHANGEWORDS electoral system as a whole,¡± CHANGEWORDS brief said. The U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated to block orders from federal judges that sought to alter state rules for conducting elections. In April, for instance, CHANGEWORDS justices, dividing 5 to 4, overturned a federal judge¡¯s order that had lengthened a deadline for absentee voting in Wisconsin. How to Vote: Many voting rules have changed this year, making it a little trickier to figure out how to cast your ballot. Here¡¯s a state-by-state guide to make sure your vote is counted. Three Main Ways to Vote: We may be in CHANGEWORDS midst of a pandemic, but whether you vote in person on Election Day, a few weeks early, or prefer to mail in your ballot this year, it can still be a straightforward process. Do You Still Have Time?: Voters in 35 states can request ballots so close to Election Day that it may not be feasible for their ballots to be mailed to them and sent back to election officials in time to be counted. Here¡¯s a list of states where it¡¯s risky to procrastinate. Fact-Checking CHANGEWORDS Falsehoods: Voters are facing a deluge of misinformation about voting by mail, some prompted by CHANGEWORDS president. Here¡¯s CHANGEWORDS truth about absentee ballots. ¡°Extending CHANGEWORDS date by which ballots may be cast by voters ? not just received by CHANGEWORDS municipal clerks but cast by voters ? for an additional six days after CHANGEWORDS scheduled Election Day fundamentally alters CHANGEWORDS nature of CHANGEWORDS election,¡± CHANGEWORDS unsigned opinion in CHANGEWORDS Wisconsin case said.

Rulings from state courts present more difficult questions, as CHANGEWORDS Supreme Court generally defers to them in cases concerning interpretations of state law and CHANGEWORDS Constitution empowers state legislatures to set CHANGEWORDS times, places and manner of congressional elections. In a second brief, CHANGEWORDS Republican Party of Pennsylvania argued that ¡°the Constitution reserves a special role for state legislatures in federal elections,¡± one that cannot be overridden by state courts. The brief relied heavily on CHANGEWORDS Supreme Court¡¯s decision in CHANGEWORDS cases culminating in Bush v. Gore, CHANGEWORDS 2000 ruling that handed CHANGEWORDS presidency to George W. Bush. ¡°By extending CHANGEWORDS deadline by judicial fiat and establishing a presumption of timeliness that will allow voters to cast or mail ballots after Election Day,¡± CHANGEWORDS brief said, ¡°the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has impermissibly altered both CHANGEWORDS ¡®time¡¯ and ¡®manner¡¯ established by CHANGEWORDS General Assembly¡± for conducting elections. In response, Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania¡¯s attorney general, a Democrat, said a provision of CHANGEWORDS State Constitution protecting ¡°free and equal elections¡± allowed CHANGEWORDS Pennsylvania Supreme Court to extend CHANGEWORDS deadline. He added that CHANGEWORDS state court¡¯s decision was ¡°consistent with how Pennsylvania law handles military and overseas ballots timely cast but not received until after Election Day.¡± Later Monday, in Tennessee, a federal appeals court exempted first-time voters from having to appear in person at CHANGEWORDS polls on Nov. 3 if they registered online or by mail, as required by a state law, which critics said would endanger residents during the pandemic. pandemic.
